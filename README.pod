=head1 Bytes-Random-Secure-Tiny

The minimal stuff needed from Bytes::Random::Secure, with no dependencies.

=head1 Description

The CPAN Module L<Bytes::Random::Secure> produces high quality pseudo-randomness using the ISAAC 
cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generation algorithm, seeded using cryptographically 
secure entropy sources on a wide variety of operating systems.  It has many configuration options.  
And provides both a functions and an object interface.  But it has several dependencies, and its 
configurability and its user-interface, while flexible and useful, may expose more complexity than 
most use-cases require.

Bytes::Random::Secure::Tiny's goal is to have no dependencies outside of the Perl core, and 
a simple interface that presents a minimal amount of configuration.  We asked ourselves, what
are the essentials, and how can we achieve them in the most light-weight way?  This module is the answer
we came up with.  We believe that this module will satisfy 90% of those users who were using
Bytes::Random::Secure, but will do so with reduced complexity, a smaller user interface, and 
none of the frustration that dependencies can bring.
